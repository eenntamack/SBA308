Here is a Learner search application that returns the array of the weighted average, the scores for each of their submitted assignments and finally their respective learners

Theres a concern with some of the due dates and submission dates that were created where it only has one submission thats 'on time'(on time or late) for both learners resspectively

while the expected output required both have _2_ submissions completed "on time/late" I adjusted the times and gave an explanation of my process with comments in the javascript file
